projects & practice

- this is where i learn and experiment with code, etc.

- learning many different kinds of projects that would be a pain to seperate so i put them altogether.

- So far have a nonfunctional webscraper and a small html website.


update :

no more info added because github is being wonky about pull requests from this repo for some reason. continued in the projects repo.
